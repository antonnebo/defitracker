Spend 1-3 hours per day checking positions across platforms
Currently use combination of DeBank, Zapper, manual spreadsheets, CEX apps
Frustrated by fragmentation but currently using free solutions
Willing to pay $10-50/month for a solution that "just works"
Not technical enough to build own tracking tools
Want mobile-first experience for monitoring on-the-go

Market Size:

Total addressable market: 15-20M active crypto users globally (based on active DeFi users + multi-exchange traders)
Serviceable addressable market: 3-5M users managing $10K+ portfolios
Target obtainable market (Year 1): 50,000 users (1% of SAM)

2. Value Proposition & Pain Points
Current Workflow - The "Tab Chaos" Problem:
Active crypto users face a daily frustration managing their growing portfolios:
Morning routine (30-60 minutes):

Open phone/laptop and start checking positions:

Binance app for CEX holdings
Coinbase app for another CEX
DeBank for Ethereum DeFi positions (but it's missing some protocols)
Zapper for LP positions (but doesn't show CEX balances)
Solana wallet for SOL ecosystem
OpenSea for NFT floor prices
Manual spreadsheet to calculate total net worth


Try to mentally calculate if they're up or down for the day
Miss seeing the full picture - "Am I actually making money overall?"

Throughout the day (multiple times, 15-30 min each):

Check prices on CoinGecko or CMC
Refresh multiple apps to see if positions changed
Wonder: "Should I rebalance? Which chain has my best returns?"
Can't answer simple questions like "What's my total exposure to ETH across all platforms?"
Miss opportunities because they didn't know they had idle USDC sitting on one chain

End of day/week (30-60 minutes):

Try to update spreadsheet with current values
Guess at P&L because cost basis is unclear
Feel overwhelmed by the complexity
Think: "There has to be a better way..."

The Real Pain Points:

Fragmentation Overwhelm:

"I have crypto on 4 different exchanges and 8 wallets. I have no idea what my actual net worth is."
Current solution: Manual spreadsheets (tedious, error-prone)
Time wasted: 5-10 hours per month


Incomplete Visibility:

"DeBank shows my DeFi but not my CEX holdings. Zapper misses some of my Solana positions."
Current solution: Use 3-4 different trackers, each showing partial picture
Result: Never have complete portfolio view


Can't Answer Basic Questions:

"Am I actually making money? What's my ROI this month?"
"Which of my strategies is performing best?"
"How much ETH do I have total across everything?"
Current solution: Give up or spend hours calculating manually


Mobile Experience Sucks:

"I can't check my full portfolio on my phone while I'm out"
Current solution: Wait until home to use desktop, or check multiple apps


CEX + DeFi Disconnect:

"I'm farming on Arbitrum but keep USDC on Binance. I forget about one while managing the other."
Current solution: Keep mental notes, often forget positions


Tax Nightmare:

"I have hundreds of transactions across multiple platforms. How do I even start with taxes?"
Current solution: Panic in April, pay accountant $500-2,000



The Hidden Costs:
For an active crypto user managing $100K portfolio:

Time cost: 10 hours/month × $50/hour opportunity cost = $500/month wasted
Opportunity cost: Missing 2-3 optimization opportunities per month = $200-500/month lost
Stress cost: Constant anxiety about "am I doing this right?" = Immeasurable
Tax cost: Extra $500-1,000 paying accountant to sort through mess

Total monthly pain: $1,200-2,000 for most active users
Jobs To Be Done:

"Help me see everything in one place" - I just want ONE app that shows my complete crypto net worth
"Help me know if I'm winning or losing" - Am I actually making money? What's my ROI?
"Help me on mobile" - I need to check my portfolio while I'm out and about
"Help me understand where my money is" - Which chains, which protocols, which strategies?
"Help me optimize" - Where should I move assets for better returns? Where is cash sitting idle?
"Help me with taxes" - Make tax season less painful

Defi Tracker helps active crypto users see their complete portfolio - across all wallets, exchanges, and chains - in one beautiful app. Know exactly where your money is, how it's performing, and what to do next. Finally, crypto portfolio management that just works.
The result: Users save 8+ hours per month, make better decisions, reduce anxiety, and actually know if they're making money - all for less than the cost of two coffees per week.

High perceived value: Saves 8+ hours/month for cost of lunch
Viral coefficient: Users can afford to recommend to friends

Why $29.99/month for Pro?

Why $79.99/month for Ultimate?

Small business budget: Companies can expense this easily
Team value: $80 for 3 people = $26/person (cheaper than Plus per person)
Tax ROI alone: Tax package saves $200-500, pays for 3-6 months

5. Go-to-Market Motion (Sales & Marketing)
DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY - VIRAL GROWTH & COMMUNITY
Our GTM strategy focuses on viral product-led growth combined with crypto-native community building. We're building for the masses - active crypto users who are eager to share tools that make their lives easier.

CORE STRATEGY: PRODUCT-LED GROWTH

Repeat

Why This Works:

Crypto users love sharing alpha/tools
Free tier is genuinely useful (no forced paywalls)
Setup takes 60 seconds (low friction)

DISTRIBUTION PHILOSOPHY:
The Bottom Line:
We're building for the 99% - the millions of active crypto users who are frustrated by portfolio fragmentation but don't have $1,000/month to spend on solutions. Our GTM motion is:

Product-led: The product itself drives growth (viral sharing, referrals)
Community-first: Be where crypto users already hang out
Content-driven: Educate and provide value before asking for money
Mobile-optimized: Meet users where they are (on their phones)
Generous free tier: Let users experience value before paying
Viral by design: Make sharing natural and incentivized

Success = becoming the default portfolio tracker for active crypto users worldwide.
The path to 1 million users starts with making 100 users incredibly happy. Then 1,000. Then 10,000. Then the flywheel spins.
